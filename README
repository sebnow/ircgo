Low-level IRC library in Go
===========================

A low level library providing mostly a parsing utility abstracting IRC
messages within a structure. This allows idiomatic code such as using
a `chan *irc.Message` to send and receive IRC messages.

A typical (though simplistic) way of using the library would be:

    messages := make(chan *irc.Message)
    conn, _ := irc.Connect("irc.freenode.net:6667")
    go func() {
        message, _ := conn.Read()
        messages <- message
    }()
    go func() {
        message <- messages
        conn.Write(message)
    }()
    // Now we can easily use channels.
    messages <- irc.NewMessage("USER go-bot")

It's obvious from the above that this library is not intended for
rapid development of bots or clients, it is rather intended as a basis
for IRC frameworks, which would better suite such development.

Installing
==========

As is standard with Go libraries, just make and install!

   make
   make test    # Optional
   make install
